# Skill Analytics for Personal Growth and Success
> Final Year Project | 2023-2024

# Introduction
Asia is renowned for its remarkable economic achievements, driven by the 
diligent labour of its workforce and rooted in a complex cultural fabric. However, there 
is a lack of study that examines the reasons behind the reputation of Asia's work culture 
for its diligent employees and high production. The objective of this study, with the 
help of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies 
(PIAAC) dataset, is to evaluate the factors that impact working hours, analyse the 
discrepancy between qualifications and employment, and explore the strategies 
individuals adopt to address skill gaps with the use of machine learning. The aim of 
these aims is to shed light on important factors that affect work productivity in Asia, 
thereby enhancing our comprehension of the region's economic viability and 
expansion.

# Objectives
1. Investigating why people work more or fewer hours than required.
2. Conducting association rule analysis to identify factors influencing the mismatch between highest academic qualification and job requirements.
3. Investigating how individuals address the skill gap when they lack the necessary qualifications for their current profession.
